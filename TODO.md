# TODO List

### Find compatibility with other versions

* 1.8
    * Enables but crashes when trying to play ender dragon noise upon resurrection (ender dragon introduced in 1.9, wither noise instead? `Caused by: java.lang.NoSuchFieldError: ENTITY_ENDER_DRAGON_GROWL`)
* 1.9
    * Doesn't enable, "compiled by more recent version of java"
    * THIS SHOULD BE FIXED AFTER MOVING TO VSCODE (using java 8)
* 1.10
    * same as 1.9
* 1.11 
    * same as 1.9
* 1.12
    * same as 1.9
