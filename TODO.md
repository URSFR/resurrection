# TODO List

### Done!
* get the player death event working

### For first release

* figure out how to get the player.data file to add a user when one joins the server for the first time
* figure out how to convert milliseconds to an actual date and time for the end user
* figure out commands and how to use them
    * `about`
    * `resurrect PLAYER` (resurrects a player now if needed)

### For later releases

* add ability to change time with new commands
    * `change-time MILLISECONDS` (0 for default 1 day wait time)
* figure out how to get a version updater working using the web server (using JSON hopefully)
